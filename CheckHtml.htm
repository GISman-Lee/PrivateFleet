        Dear Scott Allison<br />
        <br />
        This is just a gentle reminder that we are still chasing a quote for aBMW and are
        looking forward to your response.<br />
        <br />
        We are still working closely with the potential buyer and hope to have a commitment
        soon if we haven’t already.<br />
        <br />
        So if you have any questions, please let me know, otherwise I look forward to receiving
        your quote and hopefully putting a deal together!<br />
        <br />
        The quote request is waiting for you at<a href='http://quotes.privatefleet.com.au/'>quotes.privatefleet.com.au</a><br />
        <br />
        Thanks once again.<br />
        <br />
